### Hi there! 👋🐈🐿️

I'm a musician and web developer. My two last jobs were at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/), where I worked as a senior front-end engineer in the core team, and at [Shoutem](https://shoutem.com/), where I worked as a React Native and web developer.

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/file-gallery/) development used to be everything to me, but nowadays it's Javascript (Typescript, React, React Native, Electron, Node...). I'm currently playing with Web Audio API and Web MIDI to see what's possible.

🎹🎵 As a musician, my most notable release to date is the official soundtrack for ["Unity of Command II"](https://s.team/a/809230), an amazing WWII turn-based strategy game. You can get the soundtrack on [Steam](https://s.team/a/1309670) and [Bandcamp](https://aesqe.bandcamp.com/album/unity-of-command-ii-ost).

For the rest of my discography, please check out my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/aesqe) and [Bandcamp](https://aesqe.bandcamp.com) profiles.

I also have a [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/aesqe/) profile, where I occasionally upload sounds that I've recorded.

[My Twitter account](https://twitter.com/aesqe/) is not that active these days, but I still use it ☺️
