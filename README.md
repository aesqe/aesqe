### Hi there! 👋🐈🐿️

I'm a musician and web developer. I was previously employed at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) as a senior front-end engineer in the core team and at [Shoutem](https://shoutem.com/) as a React Native and web developer. I'm currently freelancing and learning about electric circuits and analog audio signals.

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/file-gallery/) development used to be everything to me, but these days, I'm mostly working with Javascript (Typescript, React, React Native, Electron, Node).
I also love working with maps and geospatial data.

🎹🎵 As a musician, my most notable release is the official soundtrack for ["Unity of Command II"](https://s.team/a/809230) - an amazing WWII turn-based strategy game. You can get the soundtrack on [Steam](https://s.team/a/1309670), [Bandcamp](https://aesqe.bandcamp.com/album/unity-of-command-ii-ost), and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/56rLUWlgBsntWTce9235o4).

Check out my other Spotify ([Aesqe](https://open.spotify.com/artist/58V3s913mdDAwil3EbwxWB)) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/aesqe) profiles for the rest of my discography.
I also have a [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/aesqe/) profile, where I occasionally upload sounds that I've recorded.

I'm not actively using my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aesqe/) account anymore, but feel free to ping me there or on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/aesqe/) ☺️
