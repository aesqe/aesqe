### Hi there! 👋🐈🐿️

I'm a web developer and a musician, currently working at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) core team as a senior front-end engineer. My previous job was at [Shoutem](https://shoutem.com/), working as a React Native and web developer.

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/file-gallery/) development used to be everything to me, but nowadays it's Javascript (vanilla, React, React Native, Electron, Node). I'm currently playing with Web Audio API and Web MIDI to see what's possible in that area.

🎹🎵 As a musician, my most notable release to date is the official soundtrack for the WWII turn-based strategy game ["Unity of Command 2"](https://s.team/a/809230). You can get the soundtrack on [Steam](https://s.team/a/1309670) and [Bandcamp](https://aesqe.bandcamp.com/album/unity-of-command-ii-ost).

For the rest of my discography, please check out my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/aesqe) and [Bandcamp](https://aesqe.bandcamp.com) profiles.

I also have a [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/aesqe/) profile, where I occasionally upload sounds that I've recorded.

[My Twitter account](https://twitter.com/aesqe/) is not that active these days, but I still use it ☺️
