### Hi there! 👋🐈🐿️

I'm a musician and web developer. I was previously employed at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) as a senior front-end engineer in the core team and at [Shoutem](https://shoutem.com/) as a React Native and web developer. I'm currently freelancing and learning about electric circuits and analog audio signals.

For the past 10 years, I've been mostly working with Javascript (Typescript, React, React Native, Electron, Node). Before that, [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/file-gallery/) development used to be everything to me.
I love working with maps and geospatial data, and I'm learning THREE.JS at the moment.

🎹🎵 As a musician, my most notable release is the official soundtrack for ["Unity of Command II"](https://s.team/a/809230) - an amazing WWII turn-based strategy game. You can get the soundtrack on [Steam](https://s.team/a/1309670), [Bandcamp](https://aesqe.bandcamp.com/album/unity-of-command-ii-ost), and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/56rLUWlgBsntWTce9235o4).

Check out my other Spotify ([Aesqe](https://open.spotify.com/artist/58V3s913mdDAwil3EbwxWB)) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/aesqe) profiles for the rest of my discography.
I also have a [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/aesqe/) profile, where I occasionally upload sounds that I've recorded.

I'm not actively using my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aesqe/) account anymore, but feel free to ping me there or on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/aesqe/) ☺️
